We should rip out WITHOUT DEPRECATION PERIOD the code that does commits and the documentation that says we do.  Let's just (1) refuse to do anything if our git status isn't clean (logically) and (2) refuse to do anything outside of a git repo (we're not agnostic about what we save into, only what we fetch from.. user should be informed of such in readme) and (3) drop all the atomic commit stuff other than to say that the user can orchestrate atomic commits by ensuring clean git status before calling us and that they commit our change wisely afterward.  This approach allows us to rip out whole swaths of code including a bunch of force logic and testing. DO ALL OF THAT CAREFULLY.
